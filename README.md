Aurelia With React (Webpack)
===================


This was started out of me trying for hours to figure out how to make React components work in the official [Aurelia-Webpack-Skeleton](https://github.com/aurelia/skeleton-navigation/tree/master/skeleton-esnext-webpack).  I found a great JSPM tutorial that aided in guiding me [How to Use React.js In Aurelia](https://ilikekillnerds.com/2015/03/how-to-use-react-js-in-aurelia/).  I want to give a lot of credit to [Dwayne](https://github.com/Vheissu) his work allowed me to forge this webpack solution.
